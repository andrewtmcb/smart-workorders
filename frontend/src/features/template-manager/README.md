Phase 2: AI Integration and Human-in-the-Loop UI
Goal: Integrate the LLM and build a user-facing editor for templates.

Milestones:

Set up the LLM API call to generate WorkOrderConfig from a natural language prompt.

Develop a visual drag-and-drop editor for the WorkOrderConfig (using a library like react-flow if applicable).

Enable users to review, edit, and approve AI-generated templates before saving.

Phase 3: Data Persistence and System Enhancements
Goal: Enable persistent data storage and expand the library of atomic components.

Milestones:

Create a mechanism to capture user-entered data from dynamically rendered forms.

Implement a database solution to store both template configurations and completed work order data.

Build additional atomic components, such as NonconformanceInput and UploadsGallery.
