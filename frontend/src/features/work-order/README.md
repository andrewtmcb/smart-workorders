Project: Work Order  System
Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the key phases and milestones for the Work Order System. It's a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.

Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
Goal: Establish the fundamental architecture and core components for dynamic rendering.

Milestones:


Define a strict TypeScript schema (WorkOrderConfig) for AI-generated configurations.

Build a reusable, atomic Button component.

Implement the dynamic DynamicView component to render a UI from the configuration.

Create an initial atomic component (SafetyInstructions) as a proof of concept.
