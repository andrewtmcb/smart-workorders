# work-order Micro-UI
Project: Work Order  System
Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the key phases and milestones for the Work Order System. It's a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.

Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
Goal: Establish the fundamental architecture and core components for dynamic rendering.

The goal of Phase 1 is to establish the fundamental architecture and a minimum viable set of components to prove the concept of dynamic, plug-and-play work orders.

Milestone 1: Foundational Architecture
This milestone focuses on creating the core blueprint of the system. Itâ€™s the most critical part, as it dictates the scalability and flexibility of everything that comes after it.

Tasks:

Finalize the WorkOrderConfig schema (config-schema.ts).

Build the DynamicView component to parse the schema and render components.

Establish the initial component-to-renderer mapping logic.

Estimated Hours: 25-35 hours

Milestone 2: Atomic Component Library (MVP Set)
Here, we build the initial "Lego blocks." The focus is on creating a small, robust set of components that demonstrate the system's capabilities.

Tasks:

Build a reusable Button component.

Build a basic TextInput component.

Build the SafetyInstructions component with acknowledgment logic.

Build a FileUpload component.

Build a Checklist component.

... The list goes on ...

Estimated Hours: 40-50 hours

Milestone 3: API Integration & Mock Data
This milestone connects the front end to a data source to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow.

Tasks:

Develop a mock API endpoint to serve a sample WorkOrderConfig JSON file.

Integrate a data-fetching layer in the DynamicView component to retrieve the configuration.

Create several sample WorkOrderConfig files that use all the new components.

.... etc ...

Estimated Hours: 15-20 hours

Milestone 4: Testing and Documentation
This final milestone ensures the MVP is stable and ready to be used as a foundation for future development.

Tasks:

Write unit tests for all new atomic components.

Write end-to-end tests for a sample work order template using Playwright.

Update the README.md and ROADMAP.md with the completed features.

Estimated Hours: 20-30 hours

Phase 1 MVP Total Estimated Hours
Total Estimated Hours: 100-135 hours
